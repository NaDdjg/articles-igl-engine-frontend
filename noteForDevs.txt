hello la team frontend this is a text file to let you know what this repo contains
as a first config from me:

- React + Vite (we didnt use create-react-app bc its a bad practice and even
the people who developed React don't recommend it anymore)
- Tailwind as a framework for css 
- Axios for making HTTP Requests to the server and handle the responses. 
(in building endpoints // communication between the backend and the frontend)
- Jest as testing framework for unit tests 


for devs:

just run : npm install 
and then :npm run dev
